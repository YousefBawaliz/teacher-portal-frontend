## User Interface Design Principles

### Layout Structure
1. **Navigation**:
   - Primary: Classes grid view on home page
   - Secondary: Sidebar or tab navigation within each class view
   - User profile and settings accessible from header

2. **Class Dashboard**:
   - Cards for each class on the main dashboard
   - Class-specific dashboard when a class is selected

3. **Information Hierarchy**:
   - Most important metrics visible immediately
   - Progressive disclosure for detailed information
   - Consistent placement of actions and navigation

4. **Visual Components**:
   - Charts for performance data
   - Tables for student lists and assessment details
   - Cards for summary information
   - Forms for data entry (assessments, grades)

### Component Structure
1. **Core Layouts**:
   - `AppLayout`: Main layout with header and container
   - `ClassLayout`: Layout for class-specific views

2. **Reusable Components**:
   - `ClassCard`: For displaying class summaries
   - `PerformanceChart`: For different data visualizations
   - `StudentListItem`: For consistent student representation
   - `AssessmentForm`: For creating/editing assessments
   - `GradeInput`: For scoring student work
   - `LoadingState`: For consistent loading indicators
   - `ErrorMessage`: For error handling

3. **Page Components**:
   - `TeacherDashboard`: Home page with class grid
   - `ClassDashboard`: Analytics for specific class
   - `StudentList`: Filterable list of students
   - `StudentDetail`: Individual student performance
   - `AssessmentList`: List of assessments
   - `AssessmentDetail`: Specific assessment with student scores
   - `GradingView`: Interface for grading student work

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**:
   - Secure handling of JWT tokens
   - Automatic token refresh
   - Proper logout mechanism

2. **Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control on routes
   - Appropriate validation in API calls

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Sanitize user inputs
   - Validate data on client and server sides
   - Secure local storage usage

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Authentication
- Initialize Vue 3 project with Vite
- Configure TypeScript and ESLint
- Set up Bootstrap and basic styling
- Implement authentication flow with JWT
- Create basic layout components

### Phase 2: Class Management
- Develop class list/grid view
- Create class detail component
- Implement class dashboard with key metrics
- Set up API integration for class data

### Phase 3: Student Management
- Create student list component with filtering
- Develop student detail view
- Implement performance visualization
- Build note-taking functionality

### Phase 4: Assessment System
- Build assessment creation form
- Develop assessment list and detail views
- Implement grading interface
- Create completion rate visualizations

### Phase 5: Analytics Dashboard
- Implement chart components
- Create dashboard widgets
- Build performance trend visualizations
- Add grade distribution charts

### Phase 6: Refinement and Polish
- Implement theme switching
- Add responsive design adjustments
- Enhance error handling
- Optimize loading states and performance
- Add final styling and animations

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Learning Vue.js 3 and TypeScript
**Solution**: Start with simple components and gradually increase complexity. Use Vue documentation and tutorials as reference, focusing on the Composition API.

### Challenge: Complex Data Visualization
**Solution**: Use Chart.js for standard charts, with custom configurations as needed. Break down complex visualizations into smaller, manageable components.

### Challenge: State Management Complexity
**Solution**: Organize Pinia stores logically by domain (classes, students, assessments). Use computed properties for derived state to keep stores clean.

### Challenge: API Integration
**Solution**: Create a dedicated API service layer that interfaces with your Pinia stores. Implement proper error handling and loading states.

### Challenge: Performance with Large Datasets
**Solution**: Implement pagination and lazy loading for lists. Consider using virtual scrolling for large tables of students or assessments.

## Future Expansion Possibilities

### Feature Enhancements
- Direct messaging system between teachers and students
- File upload for assessment submissions
- Advanced filtering and reporting capabilities
- Export functionality for reports (PDF, CSV)
- Calendar integration for assessment deadlines

### Technical Enhancements
- SSR (Server Side Rendering) for improved performance
- PWA capabilities for offline access
- Integration with learning management systems
- Mobile app version using capacitor or similar

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start Small**: Begin with core functionality and expand incrementally
2. **Component-First Approach**: Build reusable components before pages
3. **Continuous Testing**: Test components and features as they're developed
4. **Iterate**: Refine UI/UX based on usage and feedback
5. **Documentation**: Document component usage and API interactions
